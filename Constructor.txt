constructors:

call to this : Call to super() must be first statement in Derived(Student) Class constructor.

we cannot use call to this and call to super  keyword both at a time.


Concept: super keyword

--> The super keyword in java is a reference variable that is used to refer parent class objects.
--> The keyword “super” came into the picture with the concept of Inheritance.
--> Basically this form of super is used to initialize superclass variables 
--> when there is no constructor present in superclass. 
--> On the other hand, it is generally used to access the specific variable of a superclass.

// Java Program to Illustrate super keyword
 
// Class 1
// Base class
// Here it is vehicle class
class Vehicle {
 
    // Attribute
    int maxSpeed = 120; //instance variable
}
 
// Class 2
// sub class Car extending vehicle
class Car extends Vehicle {
    int maxSpeed = 180;
 
    // Method
    void display()
    {
        // Printing maxSpeed of parent class (vehicle) as
        // super keyword refers to parent class
        System.out.println("Maximum Speed: "
                           + super.maxSpeed);
    }
}
 
// Class 3
// Main class
class GFG {
 
    // Main driver method
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
        // Creating an object of child class
        Car small = new Car();
 
        // Calling out method defined inside child class
        small.display();
    }
}


Super keyword                                                                     
The super keyword in Java is a reference variable                                 
that is used to refer parent class objects.

super can be used to call parent class’ variables and methods.

The variables and methods to be called through
 super keyword can be done at any time,

If one does not explicitly invoke a superclass variables or methods, 
by using super keyword, then nothing happens



 call to super Super()

  The super() in Java is a reference variable that is 
      used to refer parent class constructors.

super() can be used to call parent class’ constructors only.

Call to super() must be first statement in Derived(Student) Class constructor.

If a constructor does not explicitly invoke a superclass constructor by using super(), 
the Java compiler automatically inserts a call to the no-argument constructor of the superclass

this:call to this

 this() should always be the first executable statement in the constructor.
 Otherwise, the program will give compile time error. 

 It is used to refer to the constructor 
  belonging to the same class.


this keyword:

 this keyword is used with the objects only.
 this refers to current object
ex:this.variablename

11: High performance

Hotspot JVM: -->1.2 --should be introduced in 1.2 version
1.3 by default it is present

JVM with jit compiler-->It is present in jvm -->Hotspot jvm

java has high performance..??

-->jvm always monitors and optimises code
-->JIT compiler -->most commonly repeated methods instead of 
translating every time we will translate one time only


Dynamic:

house-->1o members
Rice-->1 bag
per year-->12 rice bags

static programming-->all the required things will loading and start execution

Dynamic nature-->when ever we require we will be loading or loadung on demand

class Test{
   public static void amin(String[] args){
     Student s=new Student();
     Car c= new Car();
}
}

java Test

   Test.class,Student.class,Customer.class

when ever we create obeject of student and customer at the time
 only student.class and customer.class files will be generated.  //dynamic nature

for every class one .class file will be generated



JDK: Java development kit

write code-->compile that code-->run code

JRE(Java Runtime Environment)

Deliver developed application to client
-->just run application

JVM (Java Virtual machine):
convert bytecode into machine code
